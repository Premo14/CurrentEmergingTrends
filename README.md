# Treasure Hunt Game - Intelligent Pirate Agent

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of an intelligent pirate agent for a treasure hunt game. The goal of the pirate agent is to navigate through a maze and find the treasure before the human player does. The implementation utilizes deep Q-learning algorithms to train the pirate agent to make optimal decisions in a pathfinding problem.

## Project Structure

- `TreasureMaze.py`: Defines the environment, including the maze layout and rules for the treasure hunt game.
- `GameExperience.py`: Manages the storage of episodes and provides methods for training the intelligent agent through experience.
- `TreasureHuntGame.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for training and testing the pirate agent.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions used in the project.
